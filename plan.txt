You can build a small **three-part** webapp: a frontend with a “Connect Instagram” button, a backend that handles OAuth redirects and token exchange, and a simple DB (or in‑memory store) to see saved tokens while testing.[1]

Below is a concrete, minimal design you can implement in Node/Express + any frontend (plain HTML/React).

***

## High-level flow

- User clicks **Connect Instagram** → browser is redirected to `https://www.instagram.com/oauth/authorize` with your `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `scope`, `state` etc.[1]
- Instagram shows the consent screen; on success it redirects the user back to your `redirect_uri` with `?code=...` (or `?error=...` if denied).[1]
- Your backend receives `code`, calls `https://api.instagram.com/oauth/access_token` (server‑side) to get a **short‑lived access token** + `user_id`.[1]
- Optionally, backend exchanges that for a **long‑lived token** at `https://graph.instagram.com/access_token` and later refreshes via `https://graph.instagram.com/refresh_access_token`.[1]

***

## Minimal backend design

Assume: Node.js + Express.

### Environment/config needed

- `INSTAGRAM_APP_ID` (client_id).[1]
- `INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET` (client_secret).[1]
- `INSTAGRAM_REDIRECT_URI` – must exactly match one of the OAuth redirect URIs configured in the Meta App Dashboard.[1]

### Core routes

- `GET /auth/instagram`  
  - Builds the authorize URL and redirects the browser.  
  - Example scopes: `instagram_business_basic,instagram_business_manage_messages,instagram_business_manage_comments,instagram_business_content_publish`.[1]

- `GET /auth/instagram/callback`  
  - Receives `code` or `error`.  
  - If `code` present, POSTS to `https://api.instagram.com/oauth/access_token` with `client_id`, `client_secret`, `grant_type=authorization_code`, `redirect_uri`, `code`.[1]
  - On success, gets JSON containing `access_token`, `user_id`, `permissions` and stores it (for now you can store in memory or log it).[1]

- `GET /me` (test endpoint)  
  - Uses the stored `access_token` to call one of the Instagram Graph endpoints later (once you’re ready to manage the account).  

At “testing” stage, it’s enough if `/auth/instagram/callback` just prints the token and permissions in the browser.

***

## Minimal frontend design

For a simple test, even a static HTML page served by Express is enough.

- Page with:
  - A **Connect Instagram** button.  
  - On click: `window.location.href = "/auth/instagram"` (your backend route).  

No need to call the Instagram `/authorize` endpoint directly from the frontend; better to go via your backend so `redirect_uri` and `state` are consistent and you keep all secrets server‑side.[1]

***

## Example authorize URL structure

Your backend should redirect to a URL like:[1]

- `https://www.instagram.com/oauth/authorize`
  - `client_id` = your Instagram App ID.  
  - `redirect_uri` = your backend callback, e.g. `https://yourdomain.com/auth/instagram/callback`.  
  - `response_type` = `code`.  
  - `scope` = comma‑separated list of permissions.  
  - `state` = random string saved in session to protect against CSRF.  

Example (unencoded) pattern shown in docs:[1]

`https://www.instagram.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_APP_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&response_type=code&scope=instagram_business_basic,instagram_business_manage_messages,...`

***

## How to extend for “manage this client’s account”

Once your basic webapp can:

1. Redirect to Instagram.  
2. Receive `code`.  
3. Exchange `code` for `access_token`.  

…you can add:

- A step to exchange short‑lived token → long‑lived token using `GET https://graph.instagram.com/access_token?grant_type=ig_exchange_token&client_secret=APP_SECRET&access_token=SHORT_LIVED_TOKEN` in server code.[1]
- A simple DB table: `users(id, ig_user_id, access_token, token_type, expires_at, permissions)` to store tokens per client.[1]
- API routes that:
  - Look up the client’s long‑lived token.  
  - Call the relevant Instagram Graph endpoints (messages, comments, publishing) using that token.  

If you want, the next step can be actual code snippets (Express routes + a tiny HTML/React page) wired to your specific app IDs and redirect URLs.
